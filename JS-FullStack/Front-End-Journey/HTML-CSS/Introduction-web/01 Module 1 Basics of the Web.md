### **What is the Internet?**

#### **How the Internet Works (Basic Explanation for Non-IT People)**

The **Internet** is a global network that connects millions of computers, allowing them to communicate with each other. It is like a giant digital highway, enabling the transfer of data (like text, images, videos) across the world. When you use the Internet, your device sends requests for information, and other devices (like websites or services) respond to those requests.

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Servers:**
    
    - Servers are powerful computers that store data and serve it to other devices over the Internet.
    - Think of a server as a digital "warehouse" that holds websites, files, and services.
    - Example: When you type a website address in your browser, the server hosting that website sends the necessary data to your device.
2. **Clients:**
    
    - A client is any device that requests data from a server, such as your computer, smartphone, or tablet.
    - Your browser is a client that requests websites from servers to display them on your screen.
3. **Browsers:**
    
    - A **browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) is a software that allows you to access and view content on the Internet.
    - It interprets and displays the data from servers, turning it into a user-friendly webpage.

### **What is a Website?**

#### **Overview of Websites and Web Applications**

A **website** is a collection of related web pages, images, videos, and other resources that are linked together under a common domain name. Websites can serve various purposes, such as providing information, entertainment, or services.

A **web application** is a more interactive type of website that allows users to perform tasks, such as sending emails or shopping online. Unlike static websites, web applications often involve dynamic content that changes based on user input.

#### **Examples of Static vs. Dynamic Websites**

1. **Static Websites:**
    
    - Static websites have fixed content that doesn’t change unless manually updated by the website owner.
    - They are simple to build and load quickly.
    - Example: A personal portfolio or a small business homepage with basic information.
2. **Dynamic Websites:**
    
    - Dynamic websites use databases and server-side scripting to generate content that can change in real-time, based on user interactions or other factors.
    - Examples: Social media sites (like Facebook), e-commerce websites (like Amazon), and news websites where the content is regularly updated.

### **How Does a Website Load?**

#### **Role of Domain Names, IP Addresses, and DNS**

1. **Domain Name:**
    
    - A **domain name** is a human-readable address for a website, such as [www.google.com](http://www.google.com). It’s like the name of a house on a street.
    - The domain name is easier for people to remember than an IP address.
2. **IP Address:**
    
    - An **IP (Internet Protocol) address** is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to the Internet. It’s like a phone number for the device.
    - Websites are hosted on servers with specific IP addresses, and when you type a domain name in your browser, it uses the IP address to locate the server.
3. **DNS (Domain Name System):**
    
    - The **DNS** is like the Internet's phonebook. It translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling browsers to locate the servers.
    - When you type "[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)" into your browser, the DNS system finds the IP address for Google’s server and connects you to it.

#### **Introduction to HTTP/HTTPS**

1. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**
    
    - **HTTP** is a protocol used by browsers to request and transfer web pages. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted over the Internet.
    - It allows your browser to request and display web pages, and allows websites to send data back to your browser.
2. **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):**
    
    - **HTTPS** is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data exchanged between your browser and the website’s server to protect sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details.
    - Websites with HTTPS use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption to ensure that the communication is private and secure.

### **Summary:**

- The **Internet** connects devices through servers and clients, with browsers acting as intermediaries.
- A **website** is a collection of web pages, while a **web application** provides interactive, dynamic features.
- When you visit a website, the **domain name** is translated into an **IP address** by the **DNS**, and the data is transferred using **HTTP** or **HTTPS**, depending on whether the connection is secure.
