In JavaScript, **hoisting** refers to the behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.

However, **only declarations** are hoisted, not initializations (assignments). This means that variables and functions can be used before they are declared in the code, but their behavior will depend on how they are declared.

### How Hoisting Works for Variables

- **var**: When using `var`, the variable declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope, but its initialization stays in place.
    
    ```javascript
    console.log(a); // undefined (because 'a' is hoisted but not initialized yet)
    var a = 10;
    console.log(a); // 10
    ```
    
    **Explanation**: The declaration `var a;` is hoisted to the top, but the initialization `a = 10;` happens at the place where it is written.
    
- **let** and **const**: These are also hoisted, but unlike `var`, they are not initialized. They go into a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ), meaning you cannot access them before they are declared.
    
    ```javascript
    console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
    let a = 10;
    ```
    
    **Explanation**: The `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted, but their initialization is blocked until the actual line in the code.
    

### How Hoisting Works for Functions

- **Function Declarations**: Function declarations are hoisted entirely, meaning both the declaration and the definition are moved to the top.
    
    ```javascript
    myFunction(); // "Hello"
    
    function myFunction() {
      console.log("Hello");
    }
    ```
    
    **Explanation**: The entire function definition is hoisted, so you can call `myFunction()` before its declaration in the code.
    
- **Function Expressions**: If you assign a function to a variable, only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment.
    
    ```javascript
    myFunction(); // TypeError: myFunction is not a function
    
    var myFunction = function() {
      console.log("Hello");
    };
    ```
    
    **Explanation**: The variable `myFunction` is hoisted, but the function definition is assigned only at the point in the code where it appears.
    

### Summary:

- **Hoisting** refers to how JavaScript moves declarations (but not initializations) to the top of the scope.
- **`var`** declarations are hoisted with `undefined` as their value.
- **`let`** and **`const`** declarations are hoisted but are not initialized, resulting in a **"temporal dead zone"**.
- **Function declarations** are hoisted entirely, while **function expressions** are hoisted only with the variable declaration.
