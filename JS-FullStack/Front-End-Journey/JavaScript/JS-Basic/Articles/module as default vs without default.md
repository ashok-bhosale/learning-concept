The difference between these two export statements lies in **how the exported values are accessed and used** in another file.

---

### **1. `export { greet, square as default };`**

This export statement does two things:

1. Exports `greet` as a named export.
2. Exports `square` as the default export.

#### **Example**

```javascript
// File: utils.js
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
const square = (x) => x * x;

// Export greet as named and square as default
export { greet, square as default };

// File: app.js
import sq, { greet } from './utils.js'; // Import default as `sq`, named `greet`
console.log(sq(4)); // 16 (default export)
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice! (named export)
```

#### **Key Points**

- You can import the default export (`square`) using any name (`sq` here).
- You must use the exact name (`greet`) to import the named export.

---

### **2. `export { greet, square };`**

This export statement exports both `greet` and `square` as **named exports**.

#### **Example**

```javascript
// File: utils.js
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
const square = (x) => x * x;

// Export both as named exports
export { greet, square };

// File: app.js
import { greet, square } from './utils.js'; // Import both using their exact names
console.log(square(4)); // 16
console.log(greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice!
```

#### **Key Points**

- Both `greet` and `square` must be imported using their exact names.
- There is no default export here.

### **Comparison**

|Feature|`export { greet, square as default };`|`export { greet, square };`|
|---|---|---|
|**Default Export**|Exports `square` as the default export.|No default export.|
|**Named Exports**|Exports `greet` as a named export.|Exports both `greet` and `square` as named.|
|**Import Syntax (default)**|`import sq from './utils.js';`|Not available; no default export.|
|**Import Syntax (named)**|`import { greet } from './utils.js';`|`import { greet, square } from './utils.js';`|
|**Flexibility**|Can import the default (`square`) under any name.|Must use exact names for all imports.|

---

### **When to Use Which**

1. **`export { greet, square as default };`**
    
    - Use this when `square` is the primary function or value from the module, and `greet` is a secondary utility.
    - Example: A module where `square` is the main logic, and `greet` is a helper.
2. **`export { greet, square };`**
    
    - Use this when both `greet` and `square` are equally important utilities in the module.
    - Example: A module that provides multiple unrelated utilities.

---

### **Conclusion**

- Use **default exports** when thereâ€™s a clear "main" value or function in a module.
- Use **named exports** when you want to expose multiple values or functions that are equally important.
