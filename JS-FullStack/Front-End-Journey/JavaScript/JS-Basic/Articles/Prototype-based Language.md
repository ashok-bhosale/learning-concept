Yes, JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that inheritance in JavaScript is implemented through the concept of prototypes rather than classical inheritance found in class-based languages like Java or C#. Here's what it means:

### Key Concepts of Prototype-based Language

1. **Objects Inherit from Other Objects**:
    
    - In JavaScript, every object has an internal link to another object called its **prototype**. This prototype object can have its own prototype, and so on, forming a chain called the **prototype chain**.
    - If you try to access a property or method on an object and it doesnâ€™t exist on that object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find it.
2. **Prototype Property**:
    
    - Functions in JavaScript have a special property called `prototype`. This is not the prototype of the function itself but of the objects created when the function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword.
3. **`__proto__` vs `prototype`**:
    
    - Every JavaScript object (except the base `Object`) has a `__proto__` property, which is a reference to the prototype of the object.
    - The `prototype` property belongs to functions and is used to define the prototype for objects created by that function.
4. **Dynamic Inheritance**:
    
    - You can dynamically add or modify properties and methods in prototypes, and these changes will be reflected in all objects inheriting from the prototype.

### Example

```javascript
// Define a constructor function
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

// Add a method to the prototype
Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

// Create an instance
const john = new Person("John");

// Use the inherited method
john.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is John

// Check the prototype chain
console.log(john.__proto__ === Person.prototype); // true
console.log(Person.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true
```

### ES6 Classes and Prototypes

With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript supports `class` syntax, which provides a cleaner and more familiar way to define objects and handle inheritance. However, the underlying mechanism remains prototype-based.

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
}

const jane = new Person("Jane");
jane.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane
```

Even though it uses the `class` keyword, the inheritance and method sharing still occur through prototypes. The `class` syntax is essentially syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance model.
