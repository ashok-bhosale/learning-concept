### **Best Practices for Error Reporting and Debugging GraphQL Queries**

When building a **GraphQL API**, ensuring that errors are reported and debugged effectively is crucial for both development and production environments. Since GraphQL provides a rich and flexible query language, handling errors in a structured and informative manner is essential for diagnosing issues, improving user experience, and maintaining the overall health of the application.

Below are best practices for **error reporting** and **debugging GraphQL queries**.

---

### **1. Proper Error Classification and Handling**

#### **a. Use Custom Error Classes**

Use custom error classes to categorize and handle different types of errors. For example, **validation errors**, **authentication errors**, and **database errors** should be handled differently.

- **Validation errors** could include missing or invalid fields.
- **Authentication errors** can happen when a user is unauthorized.
- **Authorization errors** are thrown when a user doesn't have permission to access a resource.
- **Database errors** may be caused by connection issues or query failures.

Custom error classes help you to easily distinguish between these types and provide more detailed error handling.

```javascript
class AuthenticationError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "AuthenticationError";
    this.code = "UNAUTHORIZED";
  }
}

class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "ValidationError";
    this.code = "BAD_USER_INPUT";
  }
}
```

#### **b. Use Apollo Server's Built-In Error Handling**

Apollo Server automatically catches and formats errors, but you can customize how errors are presented to the client. Utilize the `formatError` function to ensure that errors are structured in a way that is meaningful and safe for the client.

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  formatError: (err) => {
    // Hide sensitive data in the error message
    const message = err.message.startsWith('Database error')
      ? 'Internal server error'
      : err.message;

    return {
      message,
      code: err.extensions?.code || 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR',
      path: err.path,
      locations: err.locations,
    };
  },
});
```

### **2. Categorize Errors with Meaningful Codes**

Instead of using generic error messages, use **error codes** that are easily identifiable and provide meaningful context about the issue. For example, you can return error codes for **authentication**, **authorization**, **validation**, and **internal server errors**.

For example:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Invalid email format",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "BAD_USER_INPUT",
        "validationError": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This enables the client to easily handle different types of errors.

- `BAD_USER_INPUT` for validation errors.
- `UNAUTHORIZED` for authentication errors.
- `FORBIDDEN` for authorization errors.
- `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` for generic server errors.

### **3. Handle Errors with Specificity (Granular Errors)**

When reporting errors, **be specific** about the issue. For instance, instead of returning a generic error like "Something went wrong," give users enough context to understand and act on the error. 

For example, in a mutation for creating a user, you might check whether the email is already in use or if the password doesn’t meet security criteria, and return different error messages for each case.

```javascript
if (existingUser) {
  throw new ValidationError('Email is already taken.');
}

if (password.length < 8) {
  throw new ValidationError('Password must be at least 8 characters long.');
}
```

This enables the client to display targeted error messages to users.

### **4. Use Logging and Monitoring Tools**

Proper logging and monitoring can drastically improve the debugging experience and help you identify issues early. Consider using these tools:

- **Error Tracking**: Tools like **Sentry**, **LogRocket**, or **Datadog** can help track and log errors, including stack traces, user sessions, and contextual information to aid debugging.
- **Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) to make logs more searchable. Use logging libraries like **Winston** or **Pino** for logging application-level events.

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

// Example logging setup with Winston
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' })
  ],
});

// Log an error message
logger.error('User not found', { userId: 123, requestId: 'xyz' });
```

This will allow you to correlate errors with requests, track common failure points, and quickly spot trends or recurring issues.

### **5. Enable Detailed Debugging for Development**

In a development environment, it’s important to have detailed information to troubleshoot errors. Apollo Server can expose a lot of useful data in the `extensions` field (e.g., execution times, request ids). You can also enable stack traces or more verbose logging.

#### **a. Enable Stack Traces in Development**

For local development, it's useful to get full stack traces to understand exactly where the error occurred.

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  formatError: (err) => {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      return {
        message: err.message,
        stack: err.stack, // Show stack trace in dev environment
        code: err.extensions?.code || 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR',
        path: err.path,
      };
    }

    return {
      message: err.message,
      code: err.extensions?.code || 'INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR',
      path: err.path,
    };
  },
});
```

#### **b. GraphQL Playground/Explorer**

During development, you can use **GraphQL Playground** or **GraphQL Voyager** to test and visualize your queries and mutations. These tools help you identify problems in your GraphQL queries by providing real-time feedback.

- **GraphQL Playground**: Helps test queries and provides detailed error feedback in a friendly interface.
- **GraphQL Voyager**: Visualizes the schema, making it easier to understand relationships between types and track down potential issues in your schema.

### **6. Use Apollo Client for Query Debugging**

On the client side, Apollo Client provides an easy way to debug queries by logging the request and response details. It also lets you inspect errors and responses.

#### **a. Enable Apollo Client Devtools**

For a better development experience, enable **Apollo Client DevTools** in your browser. It gives you insights into the queries, mutations, and cache, helping you debug your data flow.

To use Apollo Client DevTools:

1. Install Apollo Client DevTools in your browser (for Chrome/Firefox).
2. Use the following code to integrate with Apollo Client:

```javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';
import { ApolloClientDevTools } from '@apollo/client/devtools';

// Initialize Apollo Client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: '/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

// Render the ApolloProvider and enable DevTools
<ApolloProvider client={client}>
  {/* your app components */}
</ApolloProvider>;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  ApolloClientDevTools.enable(client);
}
```

#### **b. Query/Mutation Logging**

You can enable logging in Apollo Client to track outgoing requests and responses, which helps when debugging issues on the client side.

```javascript
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: '/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: ApolloLink.from([
    new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
      console.log(`GraphQL Request: ${operation.operationName}`);
      return forward(operation);
    }),
  ]),
});
```

### **7. Use Versioned APIs and GraphQL Deprecation Warnings**

As your schema evolves, it's essential to **version** your GraphQL API and provide deprecation warnings for fields that will be removed in the future. This will allow clients to transition smoothly and avoid breaking changes.

#### **a. Deprecate Fields Properly**

Use the `@deprecated` directive in your schema to indicate that a field or argument will be deprecated.

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String! @deprecated(reason: "Use 'contact' instead")
  contact: String!  # New field
}
```

#### **b. Versioning the API**

Consider using versioning strategies like **URL versioning** (`/v1/graphql`) or **schema versioning** (indicating version within the schema or in the response headers). This can help you track changes in production environments and notify users about breaking changes.

### **8. Implementing Query/Mutation Timeouts**

Long-running queries and mutations can impact the performance of your system and may lead to timeout errors. Set a reasonable timeout limit for operations that can run for a long time.

#### **Example: Setting Timeouts with Apollo Server**

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  engine: {
    schemaReporting: true,
    queryCache: {
      maxAge: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes cache timeout
    },
  },
  formatError: (err) => {
    if (err.message.includes("timeout")) {
      return {
        message: "Query timed out. Please try again later.",
        code: "TIMEOUT_ERROR",
      };
    }
    return err;
  },
});
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Error Classification**: Use custom error classes and error codes to categorize

 different errors (validation, authentication, database errors).
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement structured logging (e.g., Winston) and use external tools like **Sentry** or **Datadog** for real-time error tracking.
- **Stack Traces in Development**: Enable detailed stack traces for easier debugging in development environments.
- **Use GraphQL Tools**: Utilize **GraphQL Playground/Explorer** for testing queries, and **Apollo Client DevTools** for client-side debugging.
- **Deprecation Warnings**: Provide clear deprecation warnings for fields that will be removed in future versions of the API.

Following these best practices will help improve the robustness of your GraphQL API, streamline the debugging process, and enhance the overall development experience.
