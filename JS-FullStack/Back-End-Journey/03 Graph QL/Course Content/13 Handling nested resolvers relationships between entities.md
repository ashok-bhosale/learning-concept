Handling nested resolvers in GraphQL allows you to manage relationships between entities effectively. This is particularly useful when your data model has complex relationships, such as one-to-many or many-to-many associations.

### Example Scenario

Let's build on the previous example of books and authors. In this case, we'll extend the schema to include authors and their relationship with books, demonstrating how to handle nested resolvers.

### Step 1: Define the Schema

We'll define a schema where each `Author` can have multiple `Books`.

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

// Sample data
const authors = [
  { id: '1', name: 'George Orwell' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Aldous Huxley' },
];

let books = [
  { id: '1', title: '1984', authorId: '1' },
  { id: '2', title: 'Brave New World', authorId: '2' },
  { id: '3', title: 'Animal Farm', authorId: '1' },
];

// Define the schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Book {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    author: Author
  }

  type Author {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    books: [Book]
  }

  type Query {
    books: [Book]
    book(id: ID!): Book
    authors: [Author]
    author(id: ID!): Author
  }

  type Mutation {
    addBook(title: String!, authorId: ID!): Book
  }
`;
```

### Step 2: Define the Resolvers

In the resolvers, we will define how to fetch books and authors, including the nested relationships.

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
    book: (parent, args) => books.find(book => book.id === args.id),
    authors: () => authors,
    author: (parent, args) => authors.find(author => author.id === args.id),
  },
  Book: {
    author: (book) => authors.find(author => author.id === book.authorId),
  },
  Author: {
    books: (author) => books.filter(book => book.authorId === author.id),
  },
  Mutation: {
    addBook: (parent, args) => {
      const newBook = { id: String(books.length + 1), title: args.title, authorId: args.authorId };
      books.push(newBook);
      return newBook;
    },
  },
};

// Create the server
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

// Start the server
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

### Explanation of Nested Resolvers

1. **Book Resolver**:
   - The `author` resolver for the `Book` type fetches the author based on the `authorId` of the book. This is how we establish the relationship between books and authors.

2. **Author Resolver**:
   - The `books` resolver for the `Author` type fetches all books associated with the specific author. It filters the `books` array to return only those that match the author's ID.

### Example Queries and Mutations

Now, you can execute queries that take advantage of the nested resolvers:

1. **Get All Books with Authors**:
   ```graphql
   query {
     books {
       id
       title
       author {
         name
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Get an Author with Their Books**:
   ```graphql
   query {
     author(id: "1") {
       name
       books {
         title
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add a New Book**:
   ```graphql
   mutation {
     addBook(title: "Fahrenheit 451", authorId: "1") {
       id
       title
     }
   }
   ```

### Summary

Handling nested resolvers allows you to efficiently manage relationships between entities in your GraphQL API. By structuring your resolvers to fetch related data based on existing relationships, you can provide a more comprehensive and interconnected data experience. This approach enhances the usability and flexibility of your API, making it easier for clients to retrieve complex data structures in a single query.
