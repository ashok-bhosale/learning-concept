### **Unit Testing GraphQL Resolvers Using Jest or Mocha**

Unit testing is essential to ensure that your **GraphQL resolvers** behave as expected. A resolver is the function that responds to GraphQL queries and mutations, often fetching or manipulating data from databases or external APIs. Unit testing resolvers helps verify that each resolver works independently of the rest of the system.

In this guide, we’ll walk through how to write **unit tests** for GraphQL resolvers using **Jest** and **Mocha**. We will use **mocking** to isolate the resolvers from external dependencies (like databases or APIs) to focus on their core logic.

---

### **1. Setting Up the Project**

Before diving into unit testing, make sure your project is set up with GraphQL and that you have resolvers implemented.

#### **Installing Dependencies:**

You will need a few tools to help you with testing:

- **Jest** or **Mocha** for running tests.
- **graphql** and **graphql-tools** for managing schemas.
- **Apollo Server** for building the GraphQL API.
- **jest-mock** or **sinon** for mocking dependencies.

Install dependencies (choose either Jest or Mocha):

```bash
# For Jest
npm install --save-dev jest graphql apollo-server-express

# For Mocha
npm install --save-dev mocha chai sinon graphql apollo-server-express
```

---

### **2. Writing Unit Tests for GraphQL Resolvers**

Let’s look at a basic GraphQL resolver and how to unit test it using Jest and Mocha.

#### **Example Schema (GraphQL)**

Let's assume we have a simple GraphQL schema with a query for fetching a user by ID:

```graphql
type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!
}
```

And the resolver for `getUser` fetches the user from a database.

#### **Example Resolver (JavaScript)**

```javascript
const { getUserFromDB } = require('./database'); // Assume a DB function to fetch user

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getUser: async (_, { id }) => {
      const user = await getUserFromDB(id);
      if (!user) {
        throw new Error('User not found');
      }
      return user;
    },
  },
};
```

Here, the `getUser` resolver calls a database function `getUserFromDB(id)` to fetch a user by ID. If the user isn’t found, it throws an error.

---

### **3. Unit Testing with Jest**

#### **Mocking the `getUserFromDB` Function**

To unit test the resolver, we can mock the `getUserFromDB` function to avoid making actual database calls.

```javascript
// getUser.test.js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');
const { resolvers } = require('./resolvers');
const { getUserFromDB } = require('./database');
const { jest } = require('@jest/globals');

// Define GraphQL schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    getUser(id: ID!): User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    username: String!
    email: String!
  }
`;

describe('GraphQL Resolvers', () => {
  let server;

  // Mock the database function
  beforeAll(() => {
    jest.mock('./database'); // Mock the entire database module
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  // Setup Apollo Server for testing
  beforeEach(() => {
    server = new ApolloServer({
      typeDefs,
      resolvers,
    });
  });

  it('should return a user when found', async () => {
    // Arrange: mock database call to return a user
    const mockUser = { id: '1', username: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' };
    getUserFromDB.mockResolvedValue(mockUser);

    // Act: send query to server
    const result = await server.executeOperation({
      query: `query { getUser(id: "1") { id username email } }`,
    });

    // Assert: check that the user data is returned as expected
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
    expect(result.data.getUser).toEqual(mockUser);
  });

  it('should throw an error if user is not found', async () => {
    // Arrange: mock database call to return null (user not found)
    getUserFromDB.mockResolvedValue(null);

    // Act: send query to server
    const result = await server.executeOperation({
      query: `query { getUser(id: "999") { id username email } }`,
    });

    // Assert: check that an error is thrown
    expect(result.errors).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(result.errors[0].message).toBe('User not found');
  });
});
```

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Mocking**: We use `jest.mock()` to mock the `getUserFromDB` function and `mockResolvedValue()` to simulate database behavior.
2. **Apollo Server**: The `ApolloServer` is used for handling the query execution, which mimics how the actual server would process the request.
3. **Unit Testing**: We ensure that the resolver returns the expected data or throws the expected error based on the mock data.

---

### **4. Unit Testing with Mocha and Chai**

Mocha is another popular testing framework, and Chai is often used with Mocha for assertions. You can follow similar steps as in Jest, but with Mocha and Chai.

#### **Example Test Setup with Mocha and Chai**

```javascript
// getUser.test.js
const { expect } = require('chai');
const sinon = require('sinon');
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');
const { resolvers } = require('./resolvers');
const { getUserFromDB } = require('./database');

// Define GraphQL schema
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    getUser(id: ID!): User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    username: String!
    email: String!
  }
`;

describe('GraphQL Resolvers', () => {
  let server;
  let getUserFromDBStub;

  // Mock the database function using Sinon
  beforeEach(() => {
    getUserFromDBStub = sinon.stub(getUserFromDB);
    server = new ApolloServer({
      typeDefs,
      resolvers,
    });
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    sinon.restore(); // Restore original functionality after each test
  });

  it('should return a user when found', async () => {
    // Arrange: mock database call to return a user
    const mockUser = { id: '1', username: 'John', email: 'john@example.com' };
    getUserFromDBStub.resolves(mockUser);

    // Act: send query to server
    const result = await server.executeOperation({
      query: `query { getUser(id: "1") { id username email } }`,
    });

    // Assert: check that the user data is returned as expected
    expect(result.errors).to.be.undefined;
    expect(result.data.getUser).to.deep.equal(mockUser);
  });

  it('should throw an error if user is not found', async () => {
    // Arrange: mock database call to return null (user not found)
    getUserFromDBStub.resolves(null);

    // Act: send query to server
    const result = await server.executeOperation({
      query: `query { getUser(id: "999") { id username email } }`,
    });

    // Assert: check that an error is thrown
    expect(result.errors).to.have.lengthOf(1);
    expect(result.errors[0].message).to.equal('User not found');
  });
});
```

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Sinon Stubbing**: We use **Sinon** to stub the `getUserFromDB` method. `resolves` is used to simulate a resolved promise.
2. **Chai Assertions**: We use Chai's `expect` API to assert the result, checking for specific errors or data.
3. **Mocha Setup**: `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks are used to set up and clean up the testing environment.

---

### **5. Additional Testing Considerations**

- **Testing Errors**: Always test for edge cases, such as when a user is not found, when input is invalid, or when there is a database error.
- **Mocking External APIs**: If your resolvers rely on external APIs, use libraries like `nock` or `sinon` to mock HTTP requests.
- **Testing Mutations**: Testing mutations follows the same pattern as queries, but you'll also need to check the effect on the database or other side effects.

---

### **6. Running the Tests**

#### **With Jest**:

To run Jest tests, simply use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Jest will automatically find and run the tests in files with `.test.js` or `.spec.js` extensions.

#### **With Mocha**:

To run Mocha tests, use:

```bash
npx mocha getUser.test.js
```

Mocha will run all test files with `.test.js` extensions or whatever pattern you configure.

### **Conclusion**

Unit testing GraphQL resolvers is essential for ensuring that your GraphQL API behaves as expected. Whether you choose **Jest** or **Mocha**, both tools provide powerful features for mocking dependencies, writing assertions, and testing your resolvers in isolation.

1

. **Mock Database Calls**: Use Jest or Mocha's mocking tools to avoid hitting actual databases in your tests.
2. **Test for Success and Errors**: Always write tests for both successful responses and error handling scenarios.
3. **Clear and Maintainable Tests**: Write readable, clear, and maintainable tests to help you detect issues early in development.

By following these best practices, you can ensure your GraphQL resolvers are robust and error-free.
