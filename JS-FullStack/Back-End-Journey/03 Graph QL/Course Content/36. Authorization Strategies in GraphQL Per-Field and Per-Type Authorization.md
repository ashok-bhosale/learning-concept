### **Authorization Strategies in GraphQL: Per-Field and Per-Type Authorization**

In GraphQL, authorization strategies allow you to control who has access to specific data or operations, based on the user's identity and roles. Two common strategies are **Per-Field Authorization** and **Per-Type Authorization**. 

These strategies define access control at different levels of granularity in your GraphQL schema:

1. **Per-Field Authorization**: Grants or restricts access to specific fields in a query or mutation, allowing fine-grained control over the data.
2. **Per-Type Authorization**: Grants or restricts access to entire types (e.g., User, Post) based on user roles or permissions.

### **1. Per-Field Authorization**

Per-field authorization involves applying authorization logic to individual fields within a query or mutation. This strategy allows you to control access to specific data within a type.

#### **Example: Per-Field Authorization**

Let’s say we have a `User` type, and we want to restrict access to the `email` field for users with a `role` other than "admin". We also want to restrict the ability to mutate the `email` field to only the user themselves or an admin.

#### **GraphQL Schema (Per-Field Authorization)**

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  email: String!  # This field should be restricted to admins or the owner of the account
}

type Query {
  me: User!
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
  updateUser(id: ID!, username: String, email: String): User!
}
```

#### **Resolvers with Per-Field Authorization**

Now, in the resolvers, we can implement per-field authorization:

```javascript
const { AuthenticationError, ForbiddenError } = require('apollo-server');

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me: (_, __, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      return user;  // Return the currently authenticated user
    },
    getUser: (_, { id }, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      // Only allow fetching user data if the user is the same or an admin
      if (user.id !== id && user.role !== 'admin') {
        throw new ForbiddenError('You are not authorized to view this user');
      }
      return users.find(u => u.id === id);  // Assume users is an array of user data
    },
  },

  Mutation: {
    updateUser: (_, { id, username, email }, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      // Ensure the user can only update their own data or an admin can update any user
      if (user.id !== id && user.role !== 'admin') {
        throw new ForbiddenError('You are not authorized to update this user');
      }

      // Simulate updating the user (in a real app, this would interact with a DB)
      const updatedUser = users.find(u => u.id === id);
      if (updatedUser) {
        if (email && user.role !== 'admin' && user.id !== id) {
          throw new ForbiddenError('You can only update your own email');
        }
        updatedUser.username = username || updatedUser.username;
        updatedUser.email = email || updatedUser.email;
        return updatedUser;
      }
      throw new Error('User not found');
    },
  },

  User: {
    email: (user, _, { user: authUser }) => {
      // Per-field authorization: Only admins or the user themselves can access the email
      if (authUser.role !== 'admin' && authUser.id !== user.id) {
        throw new ForbiddenError('You are not authorized to view this email');
      }
      return user.email;
    },
  },
};

module.exports = resolvers;
```

#### **Explanation of Authorization Logic**:

- **Query and Mutation Level**: In the resolvers for `me`, `getUser`, and `updateUser`, we check if the current user is authenticated (`if (!user)`), and we also check their role or if they own the resource (e.g., `user.id === id`).
  
- **Per-Field Authorization**: In the `User` resolver, we check the authorization logic for the `email` field specifically. Only the user themselves or an admin can access this field. If someone else tries to access the email field, a `ForbiddenError` is thrown.

---

### **2. Per-Type Authorization**

Per-type authorization is a higher-level approach, where access control is applied to entire GraphQL types. This is useful when you need to control access to an entire resource (type) rather than individual fields.

#### **Example: Per-Type Authorization**

Let’s say we have a `Post` type and we want to restrict access to posts based on the user's role. Only an **admin** should be able to fetch **all** posts, but a regular **user** should only see their own posts.

#### **GraphQL Schema (Per-Type Authorization)**

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post!]  # This query should return all posts only for admins
  myPosts: [Post!]  # This query should return posts only for the current user
}

type Mutation {
  createPost(title: String!, content: String!): Post!
}
```

#### **Resolvers with Per-Type Authorization**

```javascript
const { AuthenticationError, ForbiddenError } = require('apollo-server');

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    posts: (_, __, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      // Only allow admins to fetch all posts
      if (user.role !== 'admin') {
        throw new ForbiddenError('You are not authorized to view all posts');
      }
      return posts;  // Assume posts is an array of posts
    },

    myPosts: (_, __, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      // Only return posts that belong to the current user
      return posts.filter(post => post.authorId === user.id);
    },
  },

  Mutation: {
    createPost: (_, { title, content }, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      // Allow anyone to create posts
      const newPost = { id: String(posts.length + 1), title, content, authorId: user.id };
      posts.push(newPost);
      return newPost;
    },
  },

  Post: {
    author: (post) => {
      return users.find(user => user.id === post.authorId);  // Assume users is an array of user data
    },
  },
};

module.exports = resolvers;
```

#### **Explanation of Per-Type Authorization**:

- **Query-Level Authorization**: In the `posts` query, we check if the user is an **admin** before returning all posts. For the `myPosts` query, we restrict access to only the posts authored by the logged-in user.

- **Authorization Logic**: The `createPost` mutation allows any authenticated user to create a post. The logic for authoring a post (`authorId: user.id`) ensures that the post is linked to the correct user.

---

### **3. Combining Per-Field and Per-Type Authorization**

You can combine both **per-field** and **per-type** authorization to enforce both broad access control (e.g., to entire types) and fine-grained control (e.g., to specific fields). 

For example:
- **Per-Type Authorization** can be used to control access to entire types, such as restricting certain types of data (like `Post`) to specific roles.
- **Per-Field Authorization** can then be used to control which fields on those types can be accessed (e.g., only admins can view sensitive fields like `email`).

#### **Combined Example**

In the following example, the `email` field is restricted to admins or the owner, but the `Post` type is visible only to admins or the post's author:

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    posts: (_, __, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      if (user.role !== 'admin') {
        throw new ForbiddenError('You are not authorized to view all posts');
      }
      return posts;
    },
    myPosts: (_, __, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      return posts.filter(post => post.authorId === user.id);
    },
  },

  Mutation: {
    createPost: (_, { title, content }, { user }) => {
      if (!user) throw new AuthenticationError('You must be logged in');
      const newPost = { id: String(posts.length + 1), title, content, authorId: user.id };
      posts.push(newPost);
      return newPost;
    },
  },

  Post: {
    author: (post, _, { user }) => {
      // Author field is restricted to admins or the post's author
      if (user.role !== 'admin' && user.id !== post.authorId) {
        throw new ForbiddenError('You are not authorized to view the author');
      }
      return users.find(u => u.id === post.authorId);
    },
  },
};
```

In this case:
- **Per-Type** authorization applies to the entire `Post` type's visibility (whether users can view posts based

 on their role).
- **Per-Field** authorization applies to the `author` field within `Post`, ensuring only the post's author or an admin can view the author's details.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Authorization strategies** in GraphQL allow you to control access to data at both the **field** and **type** levels. Here's a quick summary:

- **Per-Field Authorization**: Fine-grained control, where each field can have its own access control logic (e.g., restricting access to sensitive fields like `email`).
- **Per-Type Authorization**: Broad control over entire types, allowing you to restrict access to specific types (e.g., restricting access to all posts based on user roles).
- **Combining Both**: You can combine these strategies to enforce both fine-grained and broad access control, giving you full flexibility in securing your GraphQL API.

This allows you to build robust, secure applications that serve the right data to the right users based on their roles and permissions.
