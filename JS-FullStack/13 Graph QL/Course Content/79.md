Writing custom **GraphQL directives** allows you to add custom behavior to your GraphQL schema. Directives in GraphQL are used to modify the execution of queries, either at the field level or the schema level. They are a powerful feature for enhancing the flexibility and functionality of your GraphQL server.

### Steps to Create Custom GraphQL Directives

To create and use custom directives in a GraphQL server, you need to:

1. **Define the Directive**: Define the custom directive in your GraphQL schema.
2. **Implement the Directive Logic**: Write the code that handles the directive's behavior.
3. **Apply the Directive**: Apply the directive to fields in your schema.
4. **Integrate the Directive with Your Server**: Ensure that your GraphQL server can process and execute the directive logic.

Below is a step-by-step guide to writing custom GraphQL directives:

---

### Step 1: Define the Directive in the GraphQL Schema

Start by defining the directive in your schema using the `@directive` syntax.

For example, if you want to create a custom directive that logs the execution time of a resolver, you might define it like this:

```graphql
directive @logExecutionTime on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

This definition tells GraphQL that the directive can only be applied to fields (`FIELD_DEFINITION`).

---

### Step 2: Implement the Directive Logic

Next, you need to implement the logic that will run when the directive is encountered in a query.

If you're using Apollo Server, you can define the logic of your directive using the `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` class from the `graphql-tools` package. This allows you to specify how the directive should modify the behavior of a field.

Here’s an example of how to implement a custom `@logExecutionTime` directive:

```javascript
const { SchemaDirectiveVisitor } = require('graphql-tools');
const { defaultFieldResolver } = require('graphql');
const { performance } = require('perf_hooks');

class LogExecutionTimeDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitFieldDefinition(field) {
    const originalResolver = field.resolve || defaultFieldResolver;

    field.resolve = async function (...args) {
      const start = performance.now();

      const result = await originalResolver.apply(this, args);

      const end = performance.now();
      console.log(`Execution time for ${field.name}: ${end - start}ms`);

      return result;
    };
  }
}

module.exports = { LogExecutionTimeDirective };
```

In this example, the `LogExecutionTimeDirective` wraps the resolver for any field it is applied to. It logs the time it takes for the resolver to execute.

---

### Step 3: Apply the Directive in the Schema

Once you have the directive defined, you can apply it to the fields in your GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User @logExecutionTime
}
```

In this schema, the `@logExecutionTime` directive is applied to the `getUser` query field.

---

### Step 4: Integrate the Directive with Your Server

Finally, you need to make sure that your custom directive is registered with your GraphQL server. For Apollo Server, you can use the `schemaDirectives` option to register your custom directive.

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');
const { LogExecutionTimeDirective } = require('./directives');  // Path to the directive file

const typeDefs = gql`
  directive @logExecutionTime on FIELD_DEFINITION
  
  type Query {
    getUser(id: ID!): User @logExecutionTime
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getUser: (parent, { id }) => {
      // Simulate database call
      return { id, name: 'John Doe' };
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  schemaDirectives: {
    logExecutionTime: LogExecutionTimeDirective,
  },
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`Server is running at ${url}`);
});
```

In this code:

- `schemaDirectives` is an object where each key corresponds to the name of a custom directive (e.g., `logExecutionTime`) and the value is the implementation of that directive.
- The directive logic you created will automatically apply to any fields in the schema where the directive is used (in this case, `@logExecutionTime`).

---

### Example Use Case: Custom Directive for Field Validation

Let’s look at another example where we write a custom directive that validates whether an argument is a positive integer:

**GraphQL Schema:**

```graphql
directive @isPositive on ARGUMENT_DEFINITION

type Query {
  getItemPrice(id: ID!, discount: Int @isPositive): Float
}
```

**Directive Logic Implementation (using `SchemaDirectiveVisitor`):**

```javascript
class IsPositiveDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitArgumentDefinition(arg) {
    const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = arg;

    arg.resolve = async function (...args) {
      const value = args[arg.index];
      if (value <= 0) {
        throw new Error('Discount must be a positive integer.');
      }
      return resolve.apply(this, args);
    };
  }
}
```

**Apollo Server Setup:**

```javascript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  schemaDirectives: {
    isPositive: IsPositiveDirective,
  },
});
```

Now, when someone tries to query with a negative or zero value for the `discount` argument, it will throw an error, ensuring that only positive values are allowed.

### Common Use Cases for Custom GraphQL Directives

1. **Authorization**: Apply custom logic for field-level security (e.g., `@auth(role: "admin")`).
2. **Caching**: Apply caching logic to specific fields or types.
3. **Logging**: Track the performance or log execution details of specific fields.
4. **Validation**: Validate input arguments or fields in your schema.
5. **Transformation**: Modify query execution, for example, changing the shape or structure of the result.

---

### Conclusion

Custom GraphQL directives are a flexible tool for extending the functionality of your GraphQL API. Whether you need to add logging, authorization, validation, or caching logic, directives allow you to keep your schema clean and your logic reusable.

Remember, the use of directives should be intentional—overusing them or applying complex business logic in directives can make your schema harder to maintain and debug. They are best used for cross-cutting concerns that don’t directly belong in the resolver itself.
