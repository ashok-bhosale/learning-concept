Versioning GraphQL APIs is a bit different from traditional REST APIs, where versioning is often done using URL paths (e.g., `/v1/resource`, `/v2/resource`). With GraphQL, the goal is to minimize the need for versioning by evolving the schema in a way that maintains backward compatibility. However, when versioning is necessary, there are strategies you can use to manage changes and ensure that clients continue to function correctly.

Here’s an overview of some common approaches to versioning GraphQL APIs:

### 1. **Avoid Versioning (Schema Evolution)**
The best practice in GraphQL is to avoid explicit versioning altogether by evolving the schema in a backward-compatible manner. GraphQL is designed to be flexible and allow clients to request exactly the data they need. Therefore, as long as you don’t break existing queries, you can add, deprecate, or modify fields without breaking clients. This is known as *schema evolution*.

#### How to Evolve the Schema Without Breaking Clients:
- **Adding Fields:** You can add new fields or types to the schema. These additions won't affect existing queries, and clients that don't need the new fields will just ignore them.
- **Deprecating Fields:** You can deprecate fields using the `@deprecated` directive. Clients can be notified that a field is deprecated, but it still works for older clients.
  
  ```graphql
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    email: String @deprecated(reason: "Use 'contactEmail' instead")
    contactEmail: String
  }
  ```
- **Changing Field Return Types:** Changing return types can break clients. To mitigate this, you could add a new field and gradually phase out the old one. This gives clients time to migrate to the new field.

#### Example:
- Suppose you need to change the `email` field to `contactEmail`. Instead of changing the schema and breaking existing queries, you would add a new field `contactEmail`, deprecate the old one, and allow clients to migrate.

### 2. **Schema Versioning (API Versioning)**
If for some reason you need to introduce more radical changes to your GraphQL schema and backward compatibility is not possible, you may opt for versioning the API at the schema level. This means introducing multiple versions of the GraphQL schema, each with its own set of types and resolvers.

#### Approaches to Schema Versioning:
1. **Separate Endpoints for Each Version:**
   You can version your GraphQL API by providing different endpoints for each version. For example:
   - `/graphql/v1`
   - `/graphql/v2`
   
   Each version would have its own schema that evolves independently.

   **Pros:**
   - Clear separation between versions.
   - Can maintain major changes without impacting other clients.

   **Cons:**
   - Requires careful management of different schemas and resolvers.
   - Clients have to upgrade to newer versions at some point.

2. **Versioning Through Schema Namespaces or Directives:**
   Another approach is to version your schema internally, using different namespaces or directives to signal which version of the API the schema is using. You could use directives like `@version` to tag parts of the schema.
   
   Example:
   ```graphql
   type Query {
     getUser(id: ID!): User @version("1.0")
     getUserV2(id: ID!): User @version("2.0")
   }
   ```

   **Pros:**
   - Can manage multiple versions within the same endpoint.
   
   **Cons:**
   - Complex schema maintenance.
   - Harder to scale and may introduce inconsistencies across versions.

### 3. **GraphQL Federation and Microservices Versioning**
If you’re using GraphQL Federation (i.e., breaking your schema into subgraphs and composing them into a single schema), versioning can become more complex, especially when managing different microservices. In this case, you might version the individual microservices (or subgraphs) independently, and compose them together at the gateway.

**Example:**  
- `users-v1` (subgraph)
- `users-v2` (subgraph)
  
Clients can request different versions of individual subgraphs through the federated schema. The gateway can route requests to the correct version of each service, allowing for smoother transitions between versions.

### 4. **Client-Side Versioning**
Another approach is to version the client’s query, which may involve slightly different behavior for each version of the client application. This can be helpful if the API allows some flexibility in terms of new or deprecated fields.

For example:
- If you're using Apollo Client, you might create multiple versions of the client that use different sets of queries based on the API version.
  
  **Pros:**
  - Allows clients to control which version of the schema they interact with.

  **Cons:**
  - Requires extra work on the client side.
  - Doesn't scale as easily for a large number of clients.

### 5. **Versioning Through Schema Composition**
If you use schema stitching or composition (such as with Apollo Server or other GraphQL servers), you can have multiple schemas and decide which one to serve based on the version required.

For instance:
- You could have a `v1` and `v2` schema, and choose which one to load depending on the client’s version or API versioning.
  
This would involve programmatically deciding which schema gets served for incoming requests, and could be integrated with some kind of version header or request parameter.

### 6. **Using GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language) for Versioning**
When managing multiple versions of a schema, using SDL to define and organize different versions can help. By maintaining separate `.graphql` files for each version, you can version your schema by creating entirely separate sets of SDL files and manage them accordingly.

### Best Practices for GraphQL API Versioning
- **Deprecation Strategy:** Prefer deprecating fields instead of removing them. Always mark deprecated fields with a clear reason so that clients can migrate over time.
- **Non-Breaking Changes:** Add new fields and types rather than changing or removing existing ones. If changes to existing fields are necessary, consider adding a new field with a new name.
- **Clear Documentation:** Always document any breaking changes or major changes in the schema, especially if you are versioning the API.
- **Client Flexibility:** Design your GraphQL APIs to give clients the ability to ask for exactly what they need. This reduces the chance of a versioning issue since clients only get what they query for.

### Conclusion
The best approach to versioning GraphQL APIs depends on your specific use case, but in general, avoiding explicit versioning and evolving the schema in a backward-compatible way is recommended. If you must version the schema, use clear separation via different endpoints or careful management of versioned types and fields within the same endpoint. The goal is always to maintain a smooth experience for clients, giving them the flexibility to migrate when necessary.
