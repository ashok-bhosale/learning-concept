## Course Outline: Basic Programming for Full Stack Development

This course provides a foundational understanding of programming concepts essential for full-stack web development. It focuses on general programming principles applicable across various languages and technologies.

**Course Objectives:**

- Understand fundamental programming concepts like variables, data types, operators, control flow, and functions.
- Develop problem-solving skills using computational thinking.
- Gain basic proficiency in a programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python).
- Prepare for more advanced full-stack development topics.

**Course Structure:**

**Module 1: Introduction to Programming and Computational Thinking (2 weeks)**

- What is programming? Why is it important for full-stack development?
- Introduction to algorithms and problem-solving.
- Computational thinking: Decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.
- Setting up a development environment (code editor, interpreter/compiler).
- "Hello, World!" program and basic syntax.

**Module 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators (2 weeks)**

- Variables: Declaration, assignment, and scope.
- Data types: Integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans.
- Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
- Type conversion and casting.
- Working with user input and output.
- Practice exercises: Simple calculations, data manipulation.

**Module 3: Control Flow (3 weeks)**

- Conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`.
- Looping: `for` loops, `while` loops, `do-while` loops.
- Nested loops and conditional statements.
- Break and continue statements.
- Practice exercises: Decision-making programs, iterative processes, pattern generation.

**Module 4: Functions and Modularity (3 weeks)**

- What are functions? Why use them?
- Function declaration, parameters, and return values.
- Function scope and lifetime of variables.
- Built-in functions and libraries.
- Modular programming: Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable functions.
- Recursion (introduction).
- Practice exercises: Creating reusable functions, solving complex problems using modularity.

**Module 5: Data Structures (2 weeks)**

- Introduction to arrays (lists).
- Array manipulation: Accessing elements, adding, removing, and searching.
- Introduction to objects (dictionaries/maps).
- Key-value pairs and object properties.
- Practice exercises: Storing and processing collections of data.

**Module 6: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (2 weeks)**

- Basic OOP concepts: Classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
- Encapsulation and data hiding (brief introduction).
- This module can be adjusted based on the chosen language and its relevance to the full-stack path. If the primary focus is on JavaScript for a MERN stack, this module might be lighter or integrated with the introduction to JavaScript itself.

**Programming Language:**

A suitable language for this course would be:

- **JavaScript:** Highly relevant for full-stack JavaScript (MERN stack). Allows for front-end and back-end development with the same language.
- **Python:** Beginner-friendly with a clear syntax. Widely used in back-end development and data science.

The choice depends on the specific full-stack technologies the students will learn later.

**Assessment:**

- Regular coding exercises and assignments.
- Quizzes on key concepts.
- A final project that integrates the learned concepts.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic computer literacy.
- Enthusiasm for learning to program.

This course outline provides a solid foundation in programming principles, preparing students for the challenges of full-stack web development. The specific content and emphasis on certain topics can be adjusted based on the chosen programming language and the target full-stack technology stack.
