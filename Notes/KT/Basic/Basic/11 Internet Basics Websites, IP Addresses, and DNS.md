## Internet Basics: Websites, IP Addresses, and DNS

The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers, and understanding how we navigate it involves grasping a few key concepts: websites, IP addresses, and DNS.

**1. Websites**

- **Definition:** A website is a collection of web pages (documents) that are accessible through the internet. These pages can contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.
- **Web Servers:** Websites are hosted on computers called web servers. These servers store the website's files and deliver them to users who request them. I**IS, APACH HTTP Server, NGINX**
- **Web Browsers:** To access a website, you use a web browser (like **Chrome**, Firefox, Safari). The browser sends a request to the web server, which then sends back the website's files. The browser then interprets these files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to display the website on your screen.
- **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):** Each website has a unique address called a URL. For example, `https://www.google.com` is the URL for Google's website.

**2. IP Addresses (Internet Protocol Addresses)**

- **Definition:** An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Think of it as a device's "street address" on the internet.
- **IPv4 and IPv6:** There are two main versions of IP addresses:
    - **IPv4:** Uses 32 bits, providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. It's written in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
    - **IPv6:** Uses 128 bits, providing a vastly larger address space. It's written in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **How they work:** When you want to visit a website, your computer needs to know the IP address of the web server hosting that website.
http://localhost:8080
http://127.0.0.1:8080

**3. DNS (Domain Name System)**

- **Definition:** DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network.1 **It translates human-readable domain names (like2 `google.com`) into IP addresses that computers can understand**.
- **The "Phonebook" of the Internet:** Imagine trying to remember the phone numbers of everyone you want to call. It would be impossible! DNS acts like a phonebook for the internet, allowing us to use easy-to-remember domain names instead of complex IP addresses.
- **How it works:** When you type a domain name into your browser:
    1. Your computer contacts a DNS resolver (usually provided by your internet service provider).
    2. The resolver queries a series of DNS servers to find the IP address associated with the domain name.
    3. Once the IP address is found, the resolver sends it back to your computer.
    4. Your computer then uses the IP address to connect to the web server and retrieve the website.

**In Summary**

Websites are collections of web pages hosted on web servers. IP addresses are numerical identifiers for devices on a network. DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, making it easy for us to access websites. These three components work together to make the internet user-friendly and accessible.
