**Binary Numbers and Their Role in Computers**

Binary numbers are fundamental to how computers operate.1 Here's a breakdown:

**What are Binary Numbers?**

- The **binary number system** is a base-2 system, meaning it uses only two digits: 0 and 1
- In contrast, the **decimal system** we use daily is base-10, with digits 0 through 9
			00,223,5546,63553
**Hexgonal**  6  00X
**Octagonal** 8 
- E**ach digit in a binary number is called a "bit" (binary digit)**

**Why do Computers Use Binary?**

- **Simplicity in Hardware:** At the most basic level, computers are made of electronic circuits. These circuits can easily represent two states:
    - **On/Off:** A switch is either on (representing 1) or off (representing 0)
    - **Voltage High/Low:** An electrical signal has a high voltage (representing 1) or a low voltage (representing 0)
- **Reliability:** It's much easier for electronic circuits to reliably distinguish between two states (on/off) than to differentiate between ten different voltage levels (as would be required for a base-10 system).
- **Logic Operations:** Binary numbers are easily manipulated using Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT), which is directly implemented in computer hardware through logic gates

**How Binary is Used in Computers:**

- **Data Representation:** All types of data in a computer are ultimately stored and processed as binary numbers:
    - **Numbers:** Integers, floating-point numbers, etc., are encoded in binary
    - **Text:** Characters are represented using **encoding schemes** like ASCII or Unicode, which assign unique binary codes to each character
        "Hello"
    - **Images, Audio, Video:** These are digitized and represented as **sequences of binary data**
- **Instructions:** Computer programs consist of instructions that are also encoded in binary.
-   **The CPU (Central Processing Unit)** fetches and executes these binary instructions
- Program 2 number and addition and display user
- print(n1+n2);
- **Memory:** Computer memory (RAM) stores data as binary values, with each memory location holding a sequence of **bits**

**Example:**

The decimal number 5 is represented as 101 in binary.14 Here's why:

- In decimal: 5 = (5 × 10⁰)
- In binary: 5 = (1 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5

**In Summary:**

Binary numbers are the foundation of modern computing. Their simplicity and direct correspondence with electronic circuits make them the ideal way to represent and manipulate information within computers.
