### **1. Early History of Computing**

- **Abacus (~3000 BCE)**: The first known computing device, used for basic arithmetic calculations.
- **Mechanical Devices**:
    - **Pascaline (1642)**: A mechanical calculator invented by Blaise Pascal for addition and subtraction.
    - **Difference Engine (1822)**: Designed by Charles Babbage, considered the "father of the computer."
    - **Analytical Engine (1837)**: Babbage’s conceptual machine, capable of performing more complex calculations, introduced the concept of programmability.
- **Ada Lovelace (1840s)**: Known as the first programmer, she developed algorithms for Babbage's Analytical Engine.
