- `touch`: Create an empty file or update a file's timestamp.
- `cp`: Copy files and directories.
- `mv`: Move or rename files and directories.
- `rm`: Remove files and directories (use with caution!).
- `cat`: Concatenate and print files (displays file contents).
- `less`: View file contents one page at a time.
- `head`: Display the beginning of a file.
- `tail`: Display the end of a file.

**Module 3: File Permissions and Ownership (1 week)**

- Linux file permissions: read (r), write (w), execute (x).
- Understanding file ownership: user, group, others.
- Changing file permissions: `chmod`.
- Changing file ownership: `chown`.

**Basic Commands Covered in Module 3:**

- `chmod`: Change file permissions.
- `chown`: Change file owner and group.

**Module 4: Working with Text and Regular Expressions (2 weeks)**

- Searching for text within files: `grep`.
- Text manipulation and filtering: `sed`, `awk`.
- Introduction to regular expressions (regex).

**Basic Commands Covered in Module 4:**

- `grep`: Search for patterns in files.
- `sed`: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
- `awk`: Pattern scanning and text processing language.1

**Module 5: System Administration Basics (2 weeks)**

- User and group management: `useradd`, `userdel`, `groupadd`, `groupdel`.
- Process management: `ps`, `top`, `kill`.
- System information: `uname`, `hostname`, `df`, `du`.
- Package management (depending on the distribution): `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu), `dnf/yum` (Fedora/Red Hat).

**Basic Commands Covered in Module 5:**

- `useradd`: Add a new user.
- `userdel`: Delete a user.
- `groupadd`: Add a new group.
- `groupdel`: Delete a group.
- `ps`: Display running processes.
- `top`: Display dynamic real-time view of running processes.
- `kill`: Terminate a process.
- `uname`: Print system information.
- `hostname`: Show or set the system's hostname.
- `df`: Display disk space usage.
- `du`: Estimate file space usage.
- `apt` (or `dnf/yum`): Package management tools.

**Module 6: Basic Scripting (1 week)**

- Creating and executing simple scripts.
- Variables, loops, and conditional statements.

**Assessment:**

- Regular hands-on exercises and quizzes.
- A final project involving writing a simple Bash script to automate a task.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic computer literacy.
